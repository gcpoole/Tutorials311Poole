## Vectors

In the last tutorial, we described literals -- numerals and other characters we can enter into R to create numeric, logical, character, or date/time data.

We also covered assigning values to names using the assignment operator.

Putting those two skills together, we can store and retrieve value in R.  We can also pass named values to functions as arguments.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
example_value <- 25
example_value
sqrt(example_value)
```

Imagine doing a data analysis on millions of data points if you had to name each data point individually?  Thankfully, R doesn't make you do that.

R has many tricks up it's sleve for managing data in the computer's memory.  The most basic trick is called a "vector."

### Many values, one name

Vectors allow us to assign a collection of values to a name.  For instance, the function `c()` combines all of the arguments it receives into a vector.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
example_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5, 6)
example_vector
```

Try it yourself:

- Create a vector containing the integer values from 5 to 9 and assign it to the name `my_vector`.
- Display `my_vector`

```{r vector_using_c, exercise = tutorialize}
my_vector <- c(5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
my_vector
```

### The `...` parameter

If you are paying careful attention, you might notice that the example passed nine parameters to `c()` but in the sandbox, you passed only five parameters.

In the last tutorial, you learned that functions had a fixed number of parameters, each of which needs an argument.  So what's up with `c()`?

Let's look at the definition:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
c
```

Huh.  The parameter for `c()` is `...`.  That's odd.

In R, `...` is a special parameter.  It can accept a collection of values.  This seems to break the one argument for each parameter rule.  Later in the course, we'll discuss why this doesn't break the rule.  For now, any time you see the `...` argument, you can assume the function will take as many arguments as you would like to pass in.

## Sequences

`c()` gives you the ultimate flexibility in creating vectors, at the expense of have to type every value.  Many times, though, there are patterns to the vectors we want to create.  In these circumstance, there are operators and functions that can help.  For instance, there are simple ways to create sequences of values in R.

### Integer sequences

The `:` operator allows you to make sequences of integers with an interval of one.  Have a look:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
example_sequence <- 1:20
example_sequence
```

Can you use the `:` operator to make a vector of integers from -10 to 10?

```{r vector_using_colon_1, exercise = tutorialize}
-10:10
```

What happens when you reverse the numbers?

```{r vector_using_colon_2, exercise = tutorialize}
10:-10
```

### Real sequences

The `seq()` function is a more flexible way of making sequences.  Let's look at the definition:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
seq
```

That's not very helpful.  The definition says `seq()` uses the `...` parameter.  So we can pass anything we want.  Let's go to the help system...

Enter `?seq` into the console now.  

Read about the `from`, `to`, and `by` parameters in the help file.  

In the sandbox below:

- Call the `seq()` function; pass `30` to the `from` parameter, `40` to the `to` parameter, and `2` to the `by` parameter.

```{r vector_using_seq_1, exercise = tutorialize}
seq(30, 40, 2)
```

Try calling `seq()` again.  But this time, reverse the `from` and `to` values so that the sequence can go in reverse.  I've entered the code for you.  

Try running the code.  It will cause an error.  Now see if you can diagnose and correct the code so you get:

```{r}
seq(40,30, -2)
```

(The solution isn't available in this sandbox.  The error message has the information you need to correct the error.  Just think about it carefully...)

```{r vector_using_seq_2, exercise = tutorialize, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
#+ seq(40, 30, 2)
seq(40, 30, -2)
```

What about fractional increments? 

- call `seq()` with `from = 20`, `to = 30`, and `by = 2.2`.  Pay special attention to the final number in the resulting sequence.

```{r}
seq(30, 40, 2.2)
```

```{r seq_quiz}
quiz(
  question("Why is the final value of the last sequence 38.8 instead of 40?",
    answer("Because the difference between 40 and 38.8 is less than 2.2"),
    answer("Because 10 divided by 2.2 is not a whole number"),
    answer("Because 2.2 times 6 is greater than 40"),
    answer("All of the above.", correct = TRUE)
  )
)
```

### More on passing arguments.

`seq()` provides a good opportunity to understand a little more about passing arguments to functions.  

We've learned that it's important to pass arguments in the order expected by the function.  For instance, if we want the sequence from 10 to 100 with an interval of 5, this works:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
seq(10, 100, 5)
```

but this does not:

```{r, echo=TRUE, error = TRUE}
seq(10, 5, 100)
```

Another way to pass arguments is to use the notation `parameter_name = argument_value` within the parentheses.

If we are explicit, we can pass values in any order.  For instance:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
seq(from = 10, by = 5, to = 100)
```

Try it yourself:

- Pass the following parameters to `seq()` in the following order: `by=2`, `to=10`, `from = 0`

```{r pass_explicit_parameters, exercise = tutorialize}
#+ seq(by = ___, to = ___, from = ___)
seq(by = 2, to = 10, from = 0)
```

We can also mix explicit parameters with passing in order.  For instance:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
seq(0, by = 2, 10)
seq(by = 2, to = 10, 0)
```

In the case of a mixture of arguments -- some explicitly associated with parameters and others not -- R matches all of the parameters that have specified arguments first, and then fills in the remaining unspecified parameters with remaining arguments, by order.

For instance, in the example `seq(to = 10, by = 2, 0)`, R put `10` in the `to` parameter and `2` in the `by` parameter becuase they are named explicily.  This leaves the `from` parameter as the first unassigned parameter for `seq()`, so that's where the `0` goes.

Now you try:

- Create the same sequence as above by calling `seq()`, but pass `by` first (explicitly) and the remaining parameters by order.

```{r, pass_mixed_parameters, exercise = tutorialize}
#+ seq(by = ___, ___, ___)
seq(by = 2, 0, 10)
```

### More little more about `seq()`

`seq()` can create a sequence of a fixed length between any two numbers.  But to do this, you have to skip the `by` parameter (not pass any value to `by`), but instead, pass the length of the desired sequence to a different parameter.

Using the console, open the help for `seq()`.  Find the parameter that controls the length of the desired sequence.  Then, in the sandbox below:

- Use `seq()` create a sequence of length `10` starting at `15.23` and ending a `30.24`; to do this, you'll have to pass `10` explicitly to the length parameter that you identified in help.

```{r, fixed_length_seq, exercise = tutorialize}
seq(15.23, 30.24, length.out = 10)
```

## Repeating values

The function `rep()` creates a vector of repeated values.

Look at the help for `rep()`.   Then:

- Create a vector were the value 10 is repeated 20 times

```{r, rep_a_value, exercise = tutorialize}
rep(10, 20)
```

Now, using `rep()` and `:`

- create the following vector:
```{r}
rep(1:5, 3)
```

```{r, rep_and_colon, exercise = tutorialize}
rep(1:5, 3)
```

Now, using `rep()` and `c()`

- create the following vector:
```{r}
rep(c(5,9,2), 4)
```

```{r, rep_and_c, exercise = tutorialize, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
rep(c(5,9,2), 4)
```

## Vectors of random values

We can create vectors of random values in a number of ways.  

We'll start with the `sample()` function, which draws items at random from another vector.

`letters` is a vector built into R that contains the letters of the alphabet.  Read the help on `sample()`.

In the sandbox below:

- draw 5 letters, at random, from the `letters` vector; assign the result to the name `some_letters`
- display `some_letters`

```{r sample_letters, exercise = tutorialize}
some_letters <- sample(letters, 5)
some_letters
```

We can also draw real numbers at random from an underlying distribution such as a uniform or normal distribution using `runif()` ("random uniform") and `rnorm()` ("random normal").

Read the help for `rnorm()` and in the sandbox below:

- create a vector of 10000 random numbers drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of 3 and a standard deviation of 6; assign the vector to the name `random_normal`
- create a histogram of the vector by passing `random_normal` to a function called `hist()`.

```{r sample_normal, exercise = tutorialize}
random_normal <- rnorm(10000, mean = 3, sd = 6)
hist(random_normal)
```

## Indexing vectors

"Indexing" is a way of pulling a specific subset out of a vector.  For instance, let's consider the `letters` vector -- a character vector that is built into R.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
letters
```

To index something we use the `[` (square bracket) operator.  We can index a vector based on the position of the values in a vector.  For instance, we can extract the second half of the alphabet from letters like this:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
letters[14:26]
```

Now you try.

- Use indexing to extract the every other letter of the alphabet from `letters`, starting with the letter "b":

```{r every_other_letter, exercise = tutorialize}
letters[seq(2,26, 2)]
```

Remember, square brackets are not like parentheses.  You can't enter multiple values separated by commas.  You need to use place a vector inside the square brackets.  

Try running the following code.  You will get an error.  Then:

- Fix the code so that it returns the 13th, 19th, and 21st letter of the alphabet. 

```{r index_MSU, exercise = tutorialize}
#+ LETTERS[13, 19, 21]
LETTERS[c(13, 19, 21)]
```

Indexes don't have to be an ascending order.

- What happens when you index `letters` using all of the integers starting at 26 and descending down to 1?

```{r reverse_letters, exercise = tutorialize}
letters[26:1]
```

- What secret message you get when you pull the following positions from `letters` - c(4,15,14,20,23,15,18,18,25,2,5,8,1,16,16,25)

```{r be_happy, exercise = tutorialize}
letters[c(4,15,14,20,23,15,18,18,25,2,5,8,1,16,16,25)]
```

### Those pesky bracketed number

Now that you know what indexing is, we're ready to talk about those pesky bracketed numbers that show up when you print a vector.  The numbers are the index values -- the position of values in the vector.

Let's print a vector, in this case, a vector of 20 random numbers between 0 and 1 drawn from a uniform distribution.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
runif(20)
```

```{r}
print(runif(20), width = 50)
```

Notice that the vector is displayed in multiple rows. Each bracketed integer represents the beginning of a new row.  

NOTE: If the window for your tutorial is too narrow, individual rows might be displayed on more than one line.  If this is the case, and you have room on your computer screen, try making your tutorial window wider so that each row is on its own line.

The integer inside the brackets is the index number (position in the vector) of the first value in the row.  

If this doesn't make sense, try counting the values in the vector.  Count values in the first row and then continue your count as you move downs the rows.  Notice that every time you encounter a value at the beginning of a new row, the integer in brackets in equal to your count.  So if the value in brackets is `[5]`, then the first value on that row is the fifth value in the vector.

## Indexing with logicals

Another way to index something in R is to use a vector of logical values.  One way to create a logical vector is to use logical operators, which include:

- is eqaul to: `==` 
- is less than: `<`
- is greater than: `>`
- is less than or equal to: `<=`
- is greater than or eqaul to: `>=`
- is not equal to: `!=`

In the sandbox below, I've provided code that will create a vector of 5 random numbers, assign it to the name `random_vals` and then display the values.  Add code to:

- create a logical vector showing which values are less than 0.5 and assign the vector to the name `is_less_than_half`
- display the logical vector
- index `random_values` using the logical vector (i.e., enter `random_value[is_less_than_half]`)

```{r is_less_than_half, exercise = tutorialize}
#+ random_values <- runif(5)
#+ random_values
random_values <- runif(5)
random_values
is_less_than_half <- random_values < 0.5
is_less_than_half
random_values[is_less_than_half]
```

Once you have the code correct and have submitted it, continue to run the code several times and see what happens.  Compare the location of the values in `random_values` to the location of `TRUE` in `is_less_than_half`.  Then look at the result of `random_values[is_less_than_half]`.  Can you see what is happening?

When you index a vector using logical values (in this case, by typing `random_values[is_less_than_half]`), R selects out all of the values from the vector (`random_values`) where the index (`is_less_than_half`) is `TRUE`.  

In other words, R selects all of the values from `random_value` that are less than 0.5!!


## Value names

Until now, when we have referred to "names" in R, we've we've meant names that are associated with "objects" in R.  (When I say "object", I'm referring to things like vectors or functions.)  As you know, these object names are created and bound to an object using the assignment `<-` operator.

For instance, I can create the object name `random_vector` like this:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
random_vector <- runif(5)*10
random_vector
```

and then use it in subsequent operations:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
sqrt(random_vector)
random_vector * 10
```

There is another type of "name" in R, however.  We can name individual values within vectors.  To do this, we associated a vector of *names* with a vector of *values*.  The *names* must be contained in a character vector.  The values can be a vector of any type.  For instance, I can add value names to random vectors using the `names()` function along with the assignment operator, like so:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
names(random_vector) <- c("apple", "banana", "cherry", "dragonfruit", "eggplant")
random_vector
```

We call a vector that has value names a "named vector."

You might immediately notice that R displays *named* vectors a little differently.  Gone are the index numbers in brackets.  Instead, the value names are printed above the values.

In the sandbox below:

- Make a vector of values from 1 to 26 and assign it to the name `letter_order`.
- Display `letter order`
- Use the `names()` function with the assignment operator to set the value names in  `letter_order` equal to the `letters` vector.
- Display `letter_order` again.

```{r letter_order, exercise = tutorialize}
letter_order <- 1:26
letter_order
names(letter_order) <- letters
letter_order
```

### Indexing with names

The most important use of value names is indexing.  If you name the values, it's often times easier to work with the data.  For instance, let's say we have a vector of grades.  In the sandbox below, I've created a vector of grades for five different students -- Anna, Bently, Chloe, Douglas, and Ellen.

- Below the line of code that is provided, create a vector of the student names (in the order listed above) and assign that vector to the name `student_names`.
- Using `student_names`, the `names()` function, and the assignment operator `<-`, add value names to the `student_grades` vector.
- Display the named vector

```{r student_grades, exercise=tutorialize}
#+ student_grades <- c(89.2, 70.0, 88.2, 99.6, 62.1)
student_grades <- c(89.2, 70.0, 88.2, 99.6, 62.1)
student_names <- c("Anna", "Bently", "Chloe", "Douglas", "Ellen")
names(student_grades) <- student_names
student_grades
```
OK, now I've told you that you can index with value names.  

- See if you can extract Bently's grade from `student_grades` using the literal value `"Bently"` and square brackets `[ ]` (also known as the `[` operator).  Assign the result to the name `grade_bently`.
- Display `grade_bently`

(Note that you don't have to create student_grades again.  It's ready for use in the sandbox below.)

```{r student_grades_index, exercise=tutorialize, exercise.setup=student_grades}
grade_bently <- student_grades["Bently"]
grade_bently
```

- Try indexing `student_grades` with the value `"bently"` (note the lower case `b`)? (In this case, don't assign the result to a name... just let R display the result)

```{r grades_index_lower_case, exercise=tutorialize, exercise.setup=student_grades}
student_grades["bentley"]
```

```{r bently_quiz}
quiz(
  question("What value did indexing with `bently` return?",
    answer("70.0"),
    answer("NA", correct = TRUE),
    answer("NULL"),
    answer("Nothing. R reported an error.")
  )
)
```

- Can you extract the grades for both Chole and Ellen using indexing?

```{r grades_index_two_names, exercise=tutorialize, exercise.setup=student_grades}
student_grades[c("Chloe", "Ellen")]
```

The `names()` function can also be used to retrieve the names from a vector.  I've created a vector called `more_student_grades`.

- Display `more_student_grades`
- See if you can retrive the names from `more_student_grades` and assign those names to `more_student_names`
- Display the vector associated with `more_student_names`.

```{r more_student_names-setup}
dummy <- set.seed(330330)
more_student_grades <- 
  structure(
    runif(50) * 30 + 70,
    names = c("Jaylan", "Luke", "Haiden", "Rowan", "Tessa", "Kash", "Valentin", "Lailah", "Amare", 
              "Frankie", "Jude", "Maci", "Abigail", "Sawyer", "Lexi", "Reyna", "Elizabeth", "Rylee", "Leroy", 
              "Camren", "Jordyn", "Kaleigh", "Shyann", "Heaven", "Holden", "Alaina", "Barbara", "Miles", "Isaias", 
              "Carsen", "Tristian", "Chaz", "Chaim", "Felix", "Leilani", "Kyan", "Ashlyn", "Skylar", "Judah", 
              "Meredith", "Deangelo", "Dania", "Abdullah", "Aron", "Julianna", "Todd", "Carolyn", "Desmond",
              "Gabriela", "Lillianna"
    ))
```

```{r more_student_names, exercise=tutorialize}
more_student_grades
more_student_names <- names(more_student_grades)
more_student_names
```

The `class()` funciton shows us the class of a vector (or other R object). In the following sandbox:

- pass `more_student_grades` to the `class()` function and see what happens.

```{r more_student_grades_class, exercise=tutorialize, exercise.setup=more_student_names}
class(more_student_grades)
```

Now try with `more_student_names`

- pass `more_student_names` to the `class()` function.

```{r more_student_names_class, exercise=tutorialize, exercise.setup=more_student_names}
class(more_student_names)
```

```{r data_type_quiz}
quiz(
  question("The class of `more_student_grades` is `numeric`.  It's associated names are:",
    answer("logical data"),
    answer("character data", correct = TRUE),
    answer("also numeric data"),
    answer("a special type of data reserved for names.")
  )
)
```

The following should not surprise you:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
10 < 20
10 > 20
```

This, however, might surprise you:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
"a" < "b"
"apple" > "apps"
```

You can use `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=` to compare character strings by alphabetical order!  Strings that are later in the alphabet are considered to be "greater than" (larger) than those earlier in the alphabet.

- Can you display a logical vector that has `TRUE` anywhere the student name associated with the values in `more_student_grades` comes before the letter "E" in the alphabet?

```{r names_before_e, exercise=tutorialize, exercise.setup=more_student_names}
names(more_student_grades) < "E"
```

### An integrative challenge...

Note: There is certainly more than one way to do the following challenge.  Work on it until you think you have it right.  Then submit your answer.  If the tutorial says your code isn't what was expected, you didn't necessarily get it wrong -- you could have solved the problem in a slightly different way.  Look at the solution and compare your answer.  If you solved the problem in a different way, you'll be learning multiple ways to solve a problem in R!

OK. Here is the challenge.

Let's say you are teaching a course and your section of the course has all of the students whose first names begins with the letters A-M.

- Extract from `more_student_grades` a vector of the grades for all of the students in your section and assign the resulting vector to the name `my_student_grades`
- Display `my_student_grades`
- Use `mean()` to display the average of grades in your section.

```{r grades_for_A_to_M, exercise=tutorialize, exercise.setup=more_student_names}
my_student_grades <- more_student_grades[names(more_student_grades) < "N"]
mean(my_student_grades)
```

## Vector math and recycling

One of the most important features of R is "vector math."  

### Vector math

For instance, what happens when you:

- Create a vector of integers from 1 to 10 and assign it to the name `one_to_ten_a`;
- Create another vector of integers from 1 to 10 and assign it to the name `one_to_ten_b`;
- Use the addition operator to add `one_to_ten_a` and `one_to_ten_b`.

```{r vector_math_1, exercise=tutorialize}
one_to_ten_a <- 1:10
one_to_ten_b <- 1:10
one_to_ten_a + one_to_ten_b
```

As you can see, when you add two vectors together, the first values get added, then the second values, and so on.  The same thing is true of all of the math operators.  Try the following:

- multiply one_to_ten_a by one_to_ten_b
- divide one_to_ten_a by one_to_ten_b
- subtract one_to_ten_b from one_to_ten_a
- raise one_to_ten_a to the power of one_to_ten_b

```{r vector_math_2, exercise=tutorialize, exercise.setup=vector_math_1}
one_to_ten_a * one_to_ten_b
one_to_ten_a / one_to_ten_b
one_to_ten_a - one_to_ten_b
one_to_ten_a^one_to_ten_b
```

### Recycling

What happens when one vector is shorter that the other?  Let's find out:

- Add `one_to_ten_a` and `c(1,2)`

```{r recycling_1, exercise=tutorialize, exercise.setup=vector_math_1}
one_to_ten_a + c(1,2)
```

See the pattern there?  The `1` and `2` are added to first two values of the longer vector, but then we've exhausted the values in `c(1,2)`.

When the end of the shorter vector is reached, R "recycles" the short vector!  In other words, R goes back to the beginning of the short vector as many times as is needed and reuses the values until the end of the long vector is reached.  

In essence, R took:

```{r}
1:10
```
and added
```{r}
rep(c(1,2),5)
```

Try again, only this time:

- Add `one_to_ten_a` and `1:4`

```{r recycling_2, exercise=tutorialize, exercise.setup=vector_math_1}
one_to_ten_a + 1:4
```

Here, R took:
```{r}
1:10
```
and added

```{r}
rep(1:4, length.out=10)
```

Notice the warning message "*longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length*." You should *NEVER* ignore this warning.  

You got this warning because the last value from the short vector used in the calculation was not the final value in the short vector.  In this case, the last value used in the calculation was `2`, but the final value in the short vector is `4`.  This is almost always indicative of some sort of error in your code.  In all of my years of using R, I can remember only twice that I purposefully performed an operation on two vectors where then last value used in the short vector was taken from the middle of the short vector.

Recycling, however, is very powerful and quite necessary for R to operate correctly.  For instance, even though it may not seem obvious until you think about it, R uses recycling for the following:

```{r}
one_to_ten_a <- 1:10
```
```{r, echo=TRUE}
one_to_ten_a + 20
```

Yes, `10` creates a vector of length 1:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
length(20)
```

So the vector created by the literal value `20` is recycled ten times when it is added to `one_to_ten_a`!

In your lab this week, you'll find a situation where recycling makes life easier!

### Whew!

Wow.  That's a lot of learning packed into one tutorial!  Congratulations on finishing!  If you feel like you can't retain it all, don't worry.  You'll get to opportunity to revisit and apply these ideas many, many times before the course is over!  For now, just relax and turn in your homework using `ENSC311::submit_ENSC311()`.  When you do so, look carefully at the list of options to turn in.  They will be in alphabeticaly not chronilogical order... 

Be sure to choose the number corresponding to the homework for Lecture 7!
