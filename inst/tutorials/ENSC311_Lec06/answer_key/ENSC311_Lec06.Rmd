## Literals in R

When we work in R, we tend to work with a lot of numbers.  We're going to start our tour of R by considering how we enter numbers into R.  To understand entering numbers, we have to think about the difference between numbers and numerals.

### Numbers vs. numerals

What's the difference between numbers and numerals?  Do you know?  

Numerals are characters used to represent numbers.  The numerals we are most familiar with are *Arabic numerals:* 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.  

We are so familiar with Arabic numerals that we equate `12` with the number twelve.  We think that `12` *is* the number twelve.  `12` is not a number, however.  `12` is a series (or "string") of two Arabic numerals -- `1` and `2`, which can *represent* the number twelve.  

In fact, the number twelve is abstract.  The abstraction can be represented with many different numeral systems.  For instance:

- Arabic numerals: 12
- Roman numerals: XII
- binary notation: 1100
- hexidecimal notation: C

If you can't read all of those numeral representations twelve, don't worry.  The point is that they all use numerals (the characters, like `1` or `X` or `C`) to represent the abstract idea of the number twelve. 

### Numeric literals

In R, numeric literal data values are represented by Arabic numerals. When you type a series of Arabic numerals into the console, R interprets those numerals and creates the associated value in the computer's memory.  If we don't tell R to do anything else with a number, R converts it back to Arabic numerals and prints it out. 

For instance, consider the following:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
45.256
```

(For now, don't pay attention to the `## [1]` -- we'll talk about that later.)

Go ahead and try it.  Below is an "R sandbox" that allows you to enter and play with R code.  Enter `15.23` in the R sandbox and click on the button to run the code.  R should echo `15.23` back to you.  

Once you have gotten that to work, you can click the "submit" button.  The tutorial will check your answer and provide feedback if you have entered something unexpected.

```{r enter_numeric_literal, exercise = tutorialize}
15.23
```

If asked what happened, someone might say "I entered a number and, in response, R printed the number."  But that's not what happened...  

Rather, you entered 4 Arabic numerals (and a decimal point) and R interpreted that string of numerals to create a number in the computer's memory.  Then R reversed the process and converted the number to numerals, and printed the numerals to the screen so you could read them.

To drive home this point, I'm going to put R into "Roman numeral mode."  Watch what happens:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
12
```

```{r}
cat("[1] XII")
```

Now you can see that R interpreted the Arabic numerals `1` and `2`, created the value twelve in the computer's memory, and then printed that value to the screen by converting twelve to Roman numerals!

### OK fine. There's not really a Roman Numeral mode...

OK.  I'm kidding about "Roman numeral mode."  There's no such thing.  I just made it look like R was printing in Romand Numerals.  But the point is, there could be Roman Numeral mode.  In fact, that would be a great practical joke -- make your friend's copy of R print out all values in Roman numerals!  This would be possible by writing a "package" for R.  (Packages install new functionality.  More on packages later in the course...)

But think about it... The fact that there *could be* a "Roman numeral mode" illustrates an important point. When we enter Arabic numerals into R,  R interprets those numerals, creates values in the computer's memory, and (unless we tell R to do something else with a value), prints the values back to the screen.  So, while it looks like "nothing happens" when R receives a numeric literal, in fact, a lot happens inside R.  

This may all seem semantic, but the utility of understanding "what happens inside R" will become more apparent over time.

### Other types of data need other types of literals.

In R, data can be non-numeric, too!  For instance, there are `logical` data (just two potential values, either true or false), `character` data (data in the form of text), and `date/time` data.  The literals for these data types are:

- logical data: `TRUE` or `FALSE`
- character data: quoted text (e.g., `"Literal character"`, `"So is this"`, `"Bobcats are #1"`)
- date data: quoted date in YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., `"2024-08-24"`)

Notice the quotation marks around the character and date literals.  Quotation marks must be included in your code to make a character or date literal!

The same thing happens any time we enter any sort of literal, whether logical, character, or date.  R interprets the characters we type, creates the associated value in the computer's memory, then converts the value back to a representation we can read, and prints it to the screen.

Try entering other literals in the sandbox below.  When these tutorials ask you to use sandboxes, the instructions will be in a bulleted list, like the one below.  Typically, you will enter *one or more lines of code for each bullet point.*  

When you think you have done it correctly, press the "run code" button. When you are satisfied with your answer, press the "submit" button.  If you can't get the code to submit correctly, click the "solution" button to see what the tutorial is expecting and make any corrections in your code!

So try the following -- again, use one (or more) lines of code for each bullet point.

- Enter the literal representation of the logical value for "true."
- On a new line, enter a character literal "I am learning R!"
- On another new line, enter the date literal for July 4, 1776.

```{r try_literals, exercise = tutorialize}
TRUE
"I am learning R!"
"1776-07-04"
```

Now that we know how to use literals, we can use literals to explore how functions work in R!

## Functions

Pretty much the only way to do anything in R is to use a function.  Seriously.  That's it.

You might be able to click a button to do something in RStudio, but RStudio is almost always using R functions in the background.  Rather than click a button, there's almost always a function (or functions) you could use to accomplish the same task. 

Let's begin with a very simple function called `sqrt()`.  We use parentheses -- the `()` -- to tell R that we want to use a function.  In the case of `sqrt()`, we can put a numeric literal inside the parentheses, and `sqrt()` will calculate the square root of the associated number.  So consider:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
sqrt(25)
```

What happens here?

First, R "interprets" whatever is in the parentheses.  That is to say, R converts whatever is inside the parenthesis to a value.  *This is critical to remember.*  R will interpret *anything* you put inside the parentheses *before* running the function.

Then R "runs" the `sqrt()` function!  Or "executes" the function!  Or "calls" the function!  They all mean the same thing. In doing so:

- R gives (or "passes") the interpreted value to the function.

- the function takes that value and executes code that converts the value to some other value.

- the function "returns" the new value (the "result").

- because we didn't tell R to do anything with the result, R converts the result to some sort of printable form (e.g., Arabic numerals) and displays it on the screen.

Now you try:

- In the sandbox below, instruct R to calculate the square root of `360` and press "run code".

```{r sqrt, exercise = tutorialize}
sqrt(360)
```

Don't forget to submit your answer when you are satisfied with it!

### Arguments vs Parameters

A value passed to a function is called an "argument."  Arguments are the values that result from R interpreting whatever we put inside the parentheses when we call a function.

So a next logical question might be: "When I pass an argument to a function, where does it go?"  The argument is passed to a "parameter" of the function.  

While arguments are values that are determined at the time a function is called, parameters are characteristics of the function itself and are therefore determined when a programmer writes (or "defines") a function.  Think of parameters as placeholders for arguments.  

Every function has a set of (zero or more) parameters.  When we call the function, we must provide one argument to every parameter.

### Investigating functions

To see the parameters for any function, we can ask R to print the function's "definition."  Here's how...

Recall that putting parentheses after a function name tells R to call the function.  So what happens if we type the name of the function _without_ parentheses? 

If we don't type the parentheses, we haven't told R to call the function.  In fact, we haven't told R what to do with with the function.  If we don't tell R what to do with something, R displays it!  So if we type a function name with no parentheses, R displays the function's "definition" to us.

Give it a try:

- display the definition of the `sqrt()` function:

```{r display_sqrt, exercise = tutorialize}
sqrt
```

The function definition disappeared after you pressed the "submit" button.  To view it again, just click the "run code" button again after submitting.  (The tutorial will still remember your submission!)

By looking inside the parentheses of the definition of the `sqrt()` function, you can see that the `sqrt()` function has one parameter called `x`.  The `.Primitive("sqrt")` is the "body" of the function, or the code that gets executed when the function is run.  Don't worry that you don't understand the body; trust me, it represents computer code that calculates the square root of any argument passed to parameter `x`.  

### Wrapping it up

Here's a little mnemonic to help you remember which is which: "Arguments are actual; parameters are placeholders."

Let's take stock.

```{r parameter_argument_quiz}
quiz(
  question(
    "What are the parameters for the `sqrt()` function?",
    answer("x", correct = TRUE),
    answer("y"),
    answer("x and y"),
    answer("x, y, and z")
  ),
  question(
    "In the code `sqrt(245)`, the `245` is:",
    answer("a value that R will pass as an _argument_ to the _parameter_ `x`"),
    answer("a value that R will pass as a _parameter_ to the _argument_ `x`"),
    answer("a string of numerals that R will convert to a value; the resulting value is an _argument_ passed to the _parameter_ `x`", correct = T),
    answer("a string of numerals that R will convert to a value; the resulting value is an a _parameter_ passed to the _argument_ `x`")),
  question(
    "When you enter `sqrt(245)`, what do the parentheses tell R to do?",
    answer("Interpret the code inside the parentheses, pass the resulting value to the parameter `x`, and run the code in the body of the function", correct = T),
    answer("Pass the code inside the parentheses to the function so that the function can interpret the code"),
    answer("Convert the function to something human-readable and print the result"),
    answer("Take over the world!")
  )
)
```

### And a final point... usually nobody cares!

Be aware that, in practice, arguments and parameters are so interconnected to one another that the terms are often used interchangeably.  The context of the words determines their meaning.

Still, it's important to know the difference between the two.  Sometimes, there's no way to communicate a particular thought without discerning between arguments and parameters.  For instance, if you were to write the following code:

```{r, echo=TRUE, error=TRUE}
sqrt(1, 4)
```

and ask a friend why you were getting an error, your friend might reply "The `sqrt()` function has only one parameter; you are passing two arguments."

## The `log()` function

Now let's consider the `log()` function, which calculates logarithms.

Display the definition of the `log` function and check out its parameters:

```{r params_of_log, exercise = tutorialize}
log
```

Using the function's definition, see if you can answer the following:

```{r log_parameter_quiz}
quiz(
  question(
    "How many parameters does the `log()` function have?",
    answer("1"),
    answer("2", correct = TRUE),
    answer("4"),
    answer("6")))
```

### Multiple parameters.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
log
```

OK.  `log()` has two parameters -- `x` and `base`.  Therefore, it requires two arguments.  (You likely noticed that the definition of the `base` parameter says `base = exp(1)`.  Hold that thought -- we'll get to that...)

Functions that have more than one parameter require more than one argument.  To put all of the necessary arguments inside parentheses, we separate the arguments with commas.  

Oh, and argument order matters!  Because `x` is listed first in the function definition, The first argument you provide (inside the parentheses) will be passed to `x` and the second argument you provide will be passed to `base`.

See if you can use the `log()` function to calculate the logarithm of `100` in base `10`.  (The answer is `2`; see if you can get it right without viewing the solution first.)

```{r log_function, exercise = tutorialize}
log(100, 10)
```

### Default arguments

Now I'm going to do something a little different.  I've told you that the number of arguments passed to a function must equal the number of parameters defined in the functions.  Well, check this out:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
log(100)
```

What's going on?  I didn't pass a value for `base` but the function still returned a value.  And it returned a different value than `log(100, 10)`.

Let's look at the function definition again:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
log
```

Do you see `base = exp(1)` in the function definition?  That means that `base` has a "default" value -- a value that R will automatically pass to the `base` parameter if no other value is passed to `base`.  So what is the default value for `base`?  

Why `exp(1)` of course!  (Um... that's helpful?)

OK, sure, it's unfamiliar.  But that doesn't mean you can't figure this out.  Think for a minute... apply what you already know.  See if you can answer the following:

```{r, what_is_exp_quiz}
quiz(
  question(
    "`base = exp(1)` means:",
    answer('use "the explicit value 1" for the `base` argument.'),
    answer('that 1 is the "expected" value for the `base` argument.'),
    answer('pass the argument `1` to the `exp()` function and use the resulting value as the argument for `base`.', correct = T),
    answer('my head is going to "explode" in 1 second.')))
```

OK, if `exp(1)` is a function call, try executing it and see what you get.  (I've put the code in the sandbox for you.  All you need to do is click "run code".)

```{r whats_exp1, exercise = tutorialize}
#+ exp(1)
```

Hmmm... the default value for the `base` parameter in the `log()` function is 2.718282.  In other words, when I call `log()` with just:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
log(100)
```

the `log()` function returns the same as:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
log(100, 2.718282)
```

or, because everything in parentheses is interpreted before the function is called, we can write:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
log(100, exp(1))
```

### Summary: multiple and default parameters

The upshot, here, is that some functions have multiple parameters (require multiple arguements), and sometime parameters have default arguments.  

If you are happy using the default argument, you don't need to pass values to any parameter that has a default arguments.

### But still, what the heck is `exp()`?

If you want to know more about the `exp()` function, you can get its definition:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
exp
```

That tells you how to call the function, but it doesn't tell you what `exp()` does.  You could play with it and try to figure it out:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
exp(2)
exp(10)
exp(100)
```

but there is a better way.

## Using help in R

In R, we can use `?` to get help on functions.  It doesn't work very well in the little sandboxes within these tutorials.  Instead, try typing `?exp` in the console ("console" tab of what is usually the lower left pane in RStudio) and pressing the <enter> key.  

Enter `?exp` into the console now.

Now, look at what happened on the "Help" tab of the lower right pane.

Whoa.  That's a lot of information...

When you are a new to R, the "help" in R doesn't seem very helpful sometimes.  For now, when you use "help," just focus on the "Description" and "Usage" portions of the documentation.

If you read the description, you can see that `exp()` computes the exponential function.  Well what's that?  Maybe google "exponential function" and see what you find...

```{r, google_exponential_function}
quiz(
  question(
    "What is the 'exponential function?'",
    answer("$e^x$", correct = TRUE),
    answer("$x^y$"),
    answer("$x^2$"),
    answer("A function that allows you to read the MSU student newspaper in R.")))
```

### So how does this "help"?

Well, if `exp()` returns $e^x$, then `exp(1)` returns $e^1$.  Raising any value to the first power doesn't change the value.  Therefore, `exp(1)` must return the value of `e`.  

So, by default, `log()` will return the `log(x, base = e)`.  $log_e$ is the definition of the "natural logarithm."  So by default, `log(x)` returns the natural log of `x`.  

Of course, you didn't really have to figure this out.  As with `exp()`, you could have just typed `?log` in the console.  Try it now.

Enter `?log` in the console now.

The *Description* in the help says "`log()` computes logarithms, by default natural logarithms."

Well that was easy.

## Operators

Now that you know about functions, let's talk about operators.  `+` is an operator in R.  Can you imagine what it does?  Try running the following code:

```{r plus_operator, exercise = tutorialize}
#+ 2+2
```

Operators are functions; most have two parameters.  The arguments, however, are not placed in parentheses, but are place ahead of and after the operator.  Mathematical operators include:

- `+` adds two values
- `-` subtracts the second value from the first
- `*` multiplies two values
- `/` divides first value by second value
- `^` raises the first value to the power of the second value (e.g., `10^2` is 10 squared or 100)

There are some others, but these will get you a long ways down the road.  Try the following:

- multiply 6 by 4
- on the next line, divide 10 by 2
- on the next line raise 2 to the 3rd power.

```{r try_operators, exercise = tutorialize}
6*4
10/2
2^3
```

### Order of operations

R follows the standard order of operations for math: exponents first, then multiplication and division (left to right), finally addition and subtraction.  You can control the order of operations, however, by using parentheses.  Consider the following:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
4/1*4
4/(1*4)
```

Now you try.  If you run the following code, it will return `25`.  Add one pair of parentheses to the code so that the same code return `45` instead.

```{r play_with_parentheses, exercise = tutorialize}
#+ 5 + 4 * 5
(5 + 4) * 5
```

### Functions and the order of operations

When you call functions with `()`, they will always execute before any operators.  

Try finding the sum of the $log_{10}$ of 100 and the square root of 64. (Hint: your answer should be 10...)

```{r sum_functions, exercise = tutorialize}
log(100, 10) + sqrt(64)
```

## Names

In R, you might want to save a value for later use.  To do this, you assign the value to a name using the "assignment" operator `<-`.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
my_name <- 100
```

The assignment operator creates the name and associates a value with the name all at the same time.  Once you have created the name, you can display the associated value just by entering the name into R:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
my_name
```

Also, you can use the name in any context where you could use a literal value:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
sqrt(my_name)
log(my_name, 10)
```

Assigning values to names is a fundamental skill for using R.  You'll be asked to assign a value to a name as part of many of the tutorial exercises.  So if the instructions were to say "assign the value `1` to the name `example_value`," you'd want to put `example_value <- 1` in your code.

If you were asked to display `example_value`, you'd simply type `example_value` on a line by itself in your code.

Give it a try.  Remember, enter a command for each bullet point, in the order of the bullet points.

- assign the square root of `136` to the name `root`
- display the value of `root`
- square the value of `root` and assign the result to the name `root_squared`
- display the value of `root_squared`.

```{r square_root_squared, exercise = tutorialize}
root <- sqrt(136)
root
root_squared <- root^2
root_squared
```

### Choosing names

The best names are descriptive of the values they store.  For instance, the last exercise could have used the names `x` and `y`:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
x <- sqrt(136)
x
y <- x^2
y
```

but using the name `root` and `squared_root` gave an indication of the value the name were associated with.  When your code gets complex or after you've left it for a while and come back to it, names like `x` and `y` are not helpful for being able to read your code and understadn the role of each variable therein.

By a common convention, names in R are generally built from lower case letters, with the underscore character "_" used to separate words in multi-word names.  "height", "age", or "intercity_distance" are examples of useful and descriptive names that conform to the convention.

## Submitting tutorial results

Great job!  You've completed the assignment for Lecture 6!  Now it's time to turn it in...

In the console, enter the following (case sensitive):

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ENSC311::submit_ENSC311()
```

Your should see something like this:

```{r}
"ENSC311_Lec06_311_<Posit_Cloud_ID>"
```

where the end of the character string is an ID that Posit Cloud assigned you.  As you do more tutorials, this list of tutorials you have run will get longer.  But for now there is only one item.  Since you want to turn in the first item on the list, enter:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ENSC311::submit_ENSC311(1)
```

A "submit_ENSC311_..." file will appear under the "Files" tab in the lower right pane of RStudio.  Check the box next to the submit file and choose "Export..." from the "More" dropdown on the bar at the top of the tab.  Download the file and sumbit it to D2L.

That's it!  You're all done!
